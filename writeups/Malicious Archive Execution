üéØ Objective
The objective of this simulation is to evaluate how security tools like Sysmon and Wazuh detect the extraction and execution of a potentially malicious file contained within a password-protected archive. The goal is to determine whether it's possible to trace the origin, hash, and execution behavior of such a file using detection rules, even if traditional antivirus solutions cannot inspect the archive contents before extraction.

üß™ Simulation Steps
1- Create a Simulated Malicious Payload
   echo "malicious payload" > malware.bat
   This .bat file simulates a malicious script.

2- Bundle the Payload in a Password-Protected Archive
   & "C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7z.exe" a -p"infected123" malicious_archive.zip malware.bat
     ** -p"infected123": Sets the password.
     ** -mhe=on: (optional) Hides archive metadata for stealth.

3- Extract the Archive
   & "C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7z.exe" x malicious_archive.zip -p"infected123"
   ** You can also use the 7-Zip GUI.

4- Execute the Extracted File
   .\malware.bat
   ** This simulates a user accidentally launching the malicious payload.

‚öôÔ∏è Wazuh Custom Rule
<rule id="100150" level="8">
  <if_sid>92200</if_sid> <!-- Sysmon FileCreate (Event ID 11) -->
  <match>win.eventdata.image=.*\\(WinRAR|7zFM|7z|explorer)\.exe</match>
  <match>win.eventdata.targetFilename=.*\.(exe|bat|ps1|js)$</match>
  <description>Archive tool extracted a potentially malicious file</description>
  <group>malicious_archive</group>
</rule>

üîç What This Rule Detects
 ** Trigger Source: Detects file extraction by known archiving tools (7z.exe, WinRAR.exe, explorer.exe).
 ** Suspicious File Types: Only alerts when certain executable files are extracted (.exe, .bat, .ps1, .js).
 ** Purpose: Flags potential malware deployment by highlighting file creation activity post-archive extraction.

üìä Detection Analysis
Sysmon Logs:
  ** Event ID 11 (FileCreate) captures the creation of malware.bat and links it to the archiving tool.
  ** If executed, Event ID 1 (ProcessCreate) logs the launch of the file, including command-line arguments and hash values.

Wazuh Alerts:
  ** Correlates Sysmon logs via custom rule 100150.
  ** Groups the alert under malicious_archive for easier tracking and filtering.
  ** Provides context like parent process (e.g., 7z.exe), timestamp, and file location (e.g., Downloads folder).

‚úÖ Conclusion
This scenario demonstrates how attackers may conceal malware inside password-protected archives to bypass traditional security layers. However, using tools like Sysmon and Wazuh with the appropriate configuration, you can detect and trace this behavior effectively.
The custom rule crafted in this exercise provides a clear and actionable alert, enhancing your visibility into suspicious archive extraction events.
This reinforces the importance of behavior-based monitoring in modern endpoint defense.
