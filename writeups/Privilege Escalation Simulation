📌 Objective:
This detection logic aims to identify Privilege Escalation Attempts on Windows systems by enhancing the severity and visibility of specific security-related events. 
These include unauthorized user privilege changes and suspicious PowerShell behavior, using Wazuh’s correlation engine.

🔍 Context:
Privilege escalation is a core phase in post-exploitation where attackers elevate their privileges, often from a standard user to an administrator, to gain full control of the system. Detecting such activities early is critical to preventing persistence and lateral movement.

To address this, we created custom rules that elevate the alert level of specific built-in rules:
1. 🔒 Rule: New Member Added to a Security-Enabled Local Group

<group name="windows,security,privilege_escalation,group_addition">
  <rule id="100310" level="12">
    <if_sid>60144</if_sid>
    <description>Privilege Escalation - New user added to security-enabled local group</description>
  </rule>
</group>
🧠 Explanation:
 ** Inherits from built-in rule 60144, which maps to Event ID 4732 (A member was added to a security-enabled local group).
 ** This event could indicate an attempt to escalate privileges by adding a user to a high-privilege group such as Administrators.
 ** Severity level elevated to 12 to reflect critical risk.

2. 👥 Rule: Domain Users Group Changed

<group name="windows,security,privilege_escalation,domain_users_change">
  <rule id="100312" level="10">
    <if_sid>60160</if_sid>
    <description>Privilege Escalation - Domain Users group changed</description>
  </rule>
</group>
🧠 Explanation:
 ** Based on Wazuh SID 60160, usually linked to Event ID 4728 or similar.
 ** Detects changes to the Domain Users group, which can be abused in domain environments to grant wide access.
 ** Elevated to level 10 to ensure visibility during monitoring or alert triage.

3. ⚙️ Rule: PowerShell Dropped Executable in Windows Directory

<group name="windows,sysmon,privilege_escalation,exec_drop">
  <rule id="100313" level="12">
    <if_sid>92205</if_sid>
    <description>Privilege Escalation - PowerShell dropped executable in Windows directory</description>
  </rule>
</group>
🧠 Explanation:
 ** Inherits from custom Sysmon-based detection rule 92205 for PowerShell dropping an .exe in C:\Windows.
 ** This behavior is often used by attackers to deploy malicious payloads or persistence mechanisms with elevated privileges.
 ** Assigned critical severity (level 12), and grouped under sysmon, privilege_escalation.

📈 Final Outcome:
Once deployed, these rules provide elevated, tagged alerts for privilege escalation scenarios, enabling quick response by the SOC or blue team analysts.
