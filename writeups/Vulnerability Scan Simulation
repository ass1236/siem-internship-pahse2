📌 Objective:
To detect and alert on suspicious network activity such as port scanning, repeated connection attempts, which are common indicators of network reconnaissance or early-stage attacks.

🔍 Context:
Network reconnaissance is often one of the first steps attackers take to map out target systems and identify vulnerabilities.
Tools like Nmap can generate scan traffic that can be detected by monitoring network logs or host-based agents.

⚙️ Wazuh Custom Rule for Suspicious Network Activity

<group name="windows,admin_shares,custom"> 
  <rule id="100100" level="12">
    <if_sid>92105</if_sid>
    <description>Custom Alert: Suspicious Network Activity</description>
  </rule>
</group>
🧠 Explanation:
 ** This rule inherits from Wazuh built-in rule SID 92105, which detects network-related suspicious activity (such as connections to administrative shares or unusual network behavior).
 ** The custom rule raises the alert level to 12, highlighting it as a critical incident.
 ** Grouping it under windows and admin_shares focuses on activity involving Windows administrative shares or network access.

🔎 Practical Example: Detecting an Nmap Scan
An attacker may use the following Nmap command for stealth scanning and OS detection:
nmap -sT -T4 -A -v -Pn <victim_ip>

 ** -sT — TCP connect scan (standard scan using full TCP handshake).
 ** -T4 — Faster timing template (reduces scan time).
 ** -A — Enables OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute.
 ** -v — Verbose output.
 ** -Pn — Treat all hosts as online (skip host discovery).
This scan generates multiple TCP connection attempts across many ports, triggering network logs that Wazuh can detect through rule 92105 and your custom rule 100100.

📈 Summary:
Integrating network activity detection with Wazuh custom rules helps security teams identify suspicious scans and connection attempts indicative of early attack phases, improving incident response time and system protection.
