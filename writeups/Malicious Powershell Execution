üß† Objective:
Detect the use of encoded PowerShell commands that:
 ** Are commonly used in malicious or obfuscated attacks
 ** May be launched by Office macros or scripts
 ** Drop executable files in suspicious locations

üß™ Attack Simulation Command
On the Windows agent (vic-agent), we simulate a common attacker technique using an encoded PowerShell command that drops an executable in a suspicious location.

Command (Run as Administrator in PowerShell):

--> Start-Process powershell -ArgumentList "-EncodedCommand", "JABiAHkAdABlAHMAIAA9ACAAWwBTAHkAcwB0AGUAbQAuAFQAZQB4AHQALgBFAG4AYwBvAGQAaQBuAGcAXQA6ADoAQQBTAEMASQBJAC4ARwBlAHQAQgB5AHQAZQBzACgAJwBIAGUAbABsAG8AJwApACA7ACAAWwBTAHkAcwB0AGUAbQAuAEkATwAuAEYAaQBsAGUAXQA6ADoAVwByAGkAdABlAEEAbABsAEIAeQB0AGUAcwAoACcAQwA6AFwAVwBpAG4AZABvAHcAcwBcAGUAdgBpAGwALgBlAHgAZQAnACwAIAAkAGIAeQB0AGUAcwAp"

This base64 string executes:
$bytes = [System.Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetBytes('Hello')
[System.IO.File]::WriteAllBytes('C:\Windows\evil.exe', $bytes)

üîé What It Simulates
 ** An attacker uses an obfuscated (base64-encoded) PowerShell payload.
 ** This payload writes a binary/executable to a location often used by malware (C:\Windows\evil.exe).

üõ°Ô∏è Detection Method Using Wazuh + Sysmon

‚úÖ Built-in Wazuh Rules That Trigger:
 ** 92057 ‚Äì PowerShell.exe executed an encoded command
 ** 92205 ‚Äì PowerShell dropped a file in Windows root folder
 ** 92213 ‚Äì A suspicious executable was dropped in a location commonly used by malware

‚öôÔ∏è Custom Correlation Rule (Wazuh Local Rule)
creating a custom rule that triggers when all 3 built-in rules above fire in close succession:
<group name="custom_malicious_powershell">
  <rule id="100051" level="15" ignore="0">
    <if_matched_sid>92057</if_matched_sid>  <!-- Encoded PowerShell -->
    <if_matched_sid>92205</if_matched_sid>  <!-- File created in Windows root -->
    <if_matched_sid>92213</if_matched_sid>  <!-- Executable drop in common malware folder -->
    <description>‚ö†Ô∏è Malicious PowerShell execution: Encoded command dropped executable in suspicious location</description>
    <mitre>
      <id>T1059.001</id> <!-- PowerShell -->
      <id>T1105</id>     <!-- Ingress Tool Transfer -->
      <id>T1204.002</id> <!-- User Execution: Malicious File -->
    </mitre>
  </rule>
</group>
