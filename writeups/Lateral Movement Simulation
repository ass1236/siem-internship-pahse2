🎯 Objective
Simulate a lateral movement scenario by accessing a shared folder on another machine, copying an executable payload, and executing it remotely. 
Investigate how Windows logs this behavior, and how Wazuh detects it using Security Event Logs.

🧪 Simulation Steps
1. Accessing the Remote Share
net use \\<target-ip>\sharedtest /user:<target-ip>\<user_name> <password>
✅ This command maps the shared folder using administrative credentials.

2. Transferring the Payload
copy .\VNC-Server-7.13.1-Windows.exe \\<target-ip>\sharedtest\pay.exe
🟢 Payload is copied to the shared folder on the remote system.

3. Executing the Payload Remotely
powershell -Command "Start-Process -FilePath '\\<target-ip>\sharedtest\pay.exe'"
🟣 The executable runs directly from the shared path using PowerShell.

📋 What Windows Logs
Detection relies entirely on Windows Security Event Logs:
 ** Event ID 5145 — A network share object was accessed.
 ** Event ID 4624 — Successful logon (relevant for credentialed access).
 ** Event ID 4672 — Special privileges assigned to a new logon.
 ** Event ID 5140 — Network share was accessed (overview level).

🛠️ Agent-Side Configuration (on the target machine)
To ensure proper detection and logging by Wazuh, the agent system must be configured with the following settings:

✅ Enable Security Auditing Policies
Open Local Security Policy or use Group Policy (GPO) to enable:
 ** Audit Policy → Success and Failure:
 ** Audit Logon Events
 ** Audit Object Access
 ** Audit Detailed File Share
 ** Audit Process Creation (optional, for Event ID 4688)
These policies ensure Event IDs like 5145, 4624, and 4688 are recorded.

🚨 Wazuh Custom Rules
🧩 Rule 1: Network Share Access — Lateral Movement
<rule id="100202" level="7">
  <if_sid>67017</if_sid> <!-- Corresponds to Event ID 5145 -->
  <description>Custom Alert: Network share accessed (possible lateral movement)</description>
</rule>

🧩 Rule 2: Suspicious SMB Process Activity
<rule id="100203" level="8">
  <if_sid>92106</if_sid> <!-- Corresponds to system activity on SMB port -->
  <description>Custom Alert: Suspicious Windows system process activity over SMB port</description>
</rule>
--> These rules trigger based on built-in SIDs from Wazuh’s ruleset that rely on native Security event logs 

✅ Conclusion
This simulation demonstrated how attackers can perform lateral movement by leveraging SMB shares to copy and execute malicious files across systems in a Windows environment.It was successfully detected using native Windows Security Event Logs and custom Wazuh rules.

The key to effective detection lies in:
 ** Enabling the right audit policies (e.g., object access, logon events),
 ** Properly configuring the Wazuh agent to monitor the Security event channel,
 ** Writing meaningful custom rules to correlate suspicious SMB behavior.
